- index descriptions to run a single test

V listeners: store also the exception?
- how to distinguish before each, before all, etc. from standard

	- starting a test case
	- result of a test

- store so that the test case can be specified as a lambda
(with a parameter it of type store?)

- parameterized test?

- extension for Mockito and Guice as examples
